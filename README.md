A spec-compliant Solid server, based on a remix of [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer).

In traditional data portability, the user consents to organisation A transferring their data to organisation B.
A Solid pod, however, acts as a "pivot": data is transferred from organisation A to the pod, and from the pod to organisation B.
This greatly simplifies consent management and makes it user-centric. Hence the name "pivot" for this open source Solid server implementation.
