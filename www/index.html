      <h2>Acceptable use policy</h2>
      <p>
        This system is intended for developers and early adopters to try out the Solid platform as we continue to develop and refine it. We reserve the right to change or modify this policy at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use this system, you must understand that we cannot make any guarantees regarding the security and privacy of data that you may store in a solidcommunity.net Solid pod, or concerning the system's functionality and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, Solid Pods on Solidcommunity.net must not be used to store personal data, or any data that is otherwise sensitive, private, confidential, or intended in any way for commercial use.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use Solid, information is stored in your Solid pod and the Solid pods of other users, depending on the actions you take and the apps you use. You and other Solid pod users control who has access to that information. Some information, like your Solid profile, is public.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user of solidcommunity.net, you have the responsibility to understand what data you are storing in your Pod, with whom that data is shared, and what, if any, data you have made public.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you add public information to Solid, then you must expect this information to be visible to anyone. You must ensure that such data is appropriate, as set out below, and also suitable for the legal jurisdictions and cultural communities in which you are connected. Information shared with a limited set of people must also be written responsibly and read discerningly.
      </p>
